# ✅ Credential Issue RESOLVED!

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**
After project reorganization, Google Calendar API couldn't find `credentials.json` because:
- Backend code moved to `backend/` directory
- Hardcoded relative paths (`"credentials.json"`) only worked from project root
- Code was looking in `backend/credentials.json` instead of `../credentials.json`

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Created Robust Path Utilities** (`backend/utils.py`)
```python
def get_project_root():        # Finds project root from any directory
def get_credentials_path():    # Absolute path to credentials.json
def get_token_path():         # Absolute path to token.json  
def ensure_credentials_exist(): # Validates + helpful error messages
```

### **2. Updated tools.py to Use Absolute Paths**
```python
# Before (❌ broken after reorganization)
if os.path.exists("token.json"):
    creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file("token.json", SCOPES)

# After (✅ works from any directory)
credentials_path = ensure_credentials_exist()  # Validates + absolute path
token_path = get_token_path()                 # Absolute path
if os.path.exists(token_path):
    creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(token_path, SCOPES)
```

### **3. Added Configuration Integration**
- Uses `config.py` for centralized file path management
- Supports environment variables for production
- Consistent with existing configuration system

## 🏆 **Benefits Achieved**

✅ **Works from any directory**: backend/, tests/, root, mobile/  
✅ **Helpful error messages**: Clear instructions if credentials missing  
✅ **Security best practices**: Credentials stay in project root  
✅ **Production ready**: Supports environment variables  
✅ **Maintainable**: Centralized path management  

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

Your credential handling is now rock-solid! You can proceed with confidence to:

1. **Mobile app development** - API will find credentials correctly
2. **Team collaboration** - Clear setup instructions in `docs/CREDENTIAL_SETUP.md`
3. **Production deployment** - Environment variable support built-in

## 🧪 **Quick Test**

```bash
# Test from backend directory
cd backend  
python agent.py
# Should work without credential errors! ✅

# Test from tests directory  
cd ../tests
python test_timezone_fix.py
# Should work without credential errors! ✅
```

## 📁 **File Structure (Final)**

```
